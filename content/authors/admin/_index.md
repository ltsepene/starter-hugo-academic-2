I obtained my PhD from the University of Maryland, College Park. I was fortunate to be co-advised by professors [Aravind Srinivasan](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~srin/) and [John P. Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com/). My research interests revolve around Algorithmic Fairness and Stochastic Models for Combinatorial Optimization. Specifically, I am interested in identifying meaningful notions of fairness, translating them into rigorous mathematical objects, and incorporating them in classical algorithmic problems. For instance, my work includes fairness in Clustering and Graph Cut problems. Furthermore, I study the interplay of fairness and stochasticity, with emphasis on how the latter can ensure socially fair algorithmic solutions. Prior to joining UMD, I was lucky to be advised by professor [Dimitris Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/) during my bachelor studies at NTUA.
